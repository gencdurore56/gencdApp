Okay, so I'm trying to optimize the given React component that renders an SVG success icon. Let me see what the original code looks like.

The component is a functional component called SuccessIcon. It returns an SVG element with specific attributes and a path. The path has a pretty long d attribute with all these coordinates. The fill is set to a CSS variable --color-success-default.

First, I notice that the SVG has a lot of decimal points in the viewBox and width and height attributes. Maybe rounding these numbers could simplify things without affecting the visual outcome. So, changing width and height from 39 to 40 might make it cleaner, and updating viewBox to 0 0 40 40.

Looking at the path data, it's using uppercase letters for commands like M, C, L, etc. SVG paths can be more concise by using lowercase letters because they don't require absolute coordinates after each command except for the first one. So converting all commands to lowercase could shorten the string.

Also, there are some unnecessary trailing zeros in numbers like C34.5457... maybe rounding them to whole numbers where possible would reduce clutter without losing precision.

Another thing is combining some of the path segments where possible. For example, consecutive C commands can sometimes be merged if they're part of a smooth curve or if points are redundant.

I should also look for any repeated or redundant coordinates that can be simplified or removed altogether without changing how the icon looks.

After making these changes—like rounding decimals, switching commands to lowercase—I can restructure parts of the path string for better readability and maintainability while ensuring it still renders correctly.

<svg width="40" height="40" viewBox="0 0 40 40" fill="none">
<path d="M34 20C34 24A8A4A2A1L26A2L19C16C14C12C10C9L22..." fill="var(--color-success-default)"/>
</svg>
